BurgerTime: The Sequel
Coding Bootcamp HW15 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**burgerTime2** is a full stack food app built by Kyle Rosenmeyer. The app allows the user to devour items on the burger menu, and add/edit and remove burgers from the menu.

This app is useful to learn the principals of tying a full stack together. burgerTime uses Mysql, Express, Handlebars and Node. This app also makes use of the sequelize ORM "Sequelize" to streamline database interactions.

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however
Kyle Rosenmeyer may be contacted through his website for help or questions
regarding the project.
